##### **These track notes are short insights into the inspiration and motivation behind the tracks on the 'Versions' LP by Joshua Iz**

---

The main loop in 'Midnight Version' is from an old mambo track and just has a wonderful warm sound that makes me think of red velvet and impeccable suits.

As I often do, I started with the loop and build up rhythmically around that. Sometimes after getting into the nitty gritty of a track I end up taking the original loop out altogether yet loops are a great way to get ideas flowing quickly and in this case I left the loop in.

'Midnight Version' ended up being kind of a mash-up of mambo, hip-hop, dub and atmospheric sounds. I could really see it used in a movie.
