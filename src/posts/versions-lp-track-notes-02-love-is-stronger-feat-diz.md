##### **These track notes are short insights into the inspiration and motivation behind the tracks on the 'Versions' LP by Joshua Iz**

All props to [Diz](https://twitter.com/dizjuardo) on this track as his voice just cuts through like no one else. I had written the words and while I sang the melody to Diz horribly, he was able to pick up on what I wanted and he executed perfectly. The combination of Diz's soulful vocals with what is essentially a purely electronic track really sums up our partnership. 

That said, you'd be wrong to think "I'm the techno guy" and "Diz is the soul guy" â€” it's not like that at all. We both like the space where technology and soul meld together. If it was a Venn diagram, we would be in the overlapping purple part in the middle.

Maybe something like this:
