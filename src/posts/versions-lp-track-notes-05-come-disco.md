For a track like this, I think I'm supposed to hint at what I sampled and explain how much the original track meant to me but I can't even remember for the life of me what it was. What I _can_ tell you is I played the keys and I quite like how the electronic strings lay on top of the disco loop. 

This track was finished in a few hours â€” it was one of those times where everything just came together quickly. Yet, as you get more experienced making tracks it's not as if the stars just align and a track just falls in your lap. You not only just know what sound(s) to add but how to make them sound like what you have in your head. 

When you can do that, it is pretty much like magic.
