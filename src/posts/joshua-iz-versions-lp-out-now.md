My second full-length album, 'Versions' is out now at the <a href="https://vizualrecords.com/catalog/albums/vizlp3" target="_blank">Vizual Store</a> and <a href="https://vizual.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Bandcamp</a> and all fine digital and streaming outlets.

Released on 14 February 2018, exactly 7 years to the day of when my debut album 'It Iz What It Iz' was released. I've been working on the tracks for this collection since then, swapping out tracks and creating new ones until finally I decided it was time. 'Versions' is meant for digital release only and as such I didn't edit the tracks down to fit a particular physical format â€” I left the tracks as I recorded them.

Tracks include 'Love Is Stronger feat. Diz', 'Like Gold feat. Marissa Guzman' and 'Love Version'. Already massive support from DJ Sneak, Brett Johnson, Fred Everything, Mark Farina, DJ Heather and many more.
