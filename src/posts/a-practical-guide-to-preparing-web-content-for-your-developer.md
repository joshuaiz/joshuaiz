### A message from a developer to content managers, marketing teams, and point people: help us help you.

Your team has decided on a redesign or a new website, you've hired a developer or an agency to perform the work and it's full steam ahead. Great! 

Here are a few tips from a developer on how to provide content in a way that makes our jobs easier. And it will help you get organized as well. That seems like a win-win to me.

## Tip #1: One space after a period. Period.
If you were taught two spaces after a period in school, that doesn't apply to digital text. **Use only one space after a period** otherwise we have to go in and fix it. Everywhere.

## Tip #2: Use proper dashes:

— **em dash** (Shift-Option-Dash): for setting off words
or clauses — like this one — in a sentence.

– **en dash** (Option-Dash): for sequences e.g. 4–8 months.

&minus; **hyphen/dash**: for hyphenated words


## Tip #3: Use Spell Check.
As developers, we are often the last line of defense before your content is published to the world. We don't want you to look bad so if we see errors in your text — including spelling errors — we _will_ fix them. 

Still, it's not that hard to use the spell check tools in your applications and save us this step.

## Tip #4: Keep things consistent.
If you have a section labeled 'The Challenge' in one place, then 'Our Challenge' somewhere else, then 'Challenges' in another place and they are all referring to the same thing, then either we have to decide which one to use or contact you to clarify. If you can, make this decision and apply your choice(s) before sending your content to us

Consistency also applies to text. If you have bulleted lists, either add a period at the end of each bullet point or don't — it's really up to you. **But don't do both.** It may seem like a little thing but fixing all of these takes valuable time.

## Tip #5: Don't embed everything in a Word doc.
Developers are pretty used to getting content in all kinds of ways and formats: via email, Dropbox, PDFs, spreadsheets, PowerPoint files — you name it, we've seen it.

Yet, the worst way to receive content is a _pre-formatted_ Word document with all of the images and links embedded in the file. There's nothing wrong with Word documents per se but if you are going to use Word, don't add more than basic formatting (bold, italic, etc.), send the images separately, and include footnotes to links instead of embedding urls into the text. Or at least include full url links after the linked text.

> If you pre-format your document to make it look like you want, that only creates more work for the developer.

If you pre-format your document to make it look like you want, that only creates more work for the developer as we have to strip out all of the styles and formatting you've added, only to add it again with HTML. 

Leave your files as plain as possible and your developer will thank you.
